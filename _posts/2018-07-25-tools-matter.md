I've been going back through the last few years' projects looking for possible content for this site. I rediscovered a simple Blender fluid simulation and was reminded of a long-standing argument I have with myself. I'd like to present that argument here as a way of potentially burying the hatchet.

## In computer graphics, the carpenter can blame his tools.

If you have to wait for a computer to finish before you can evaluate your creative decisions, the process of learning to predict the outcome of those decisions and make better ones takes much longer. This is true of any field requiring intense computation, but CG's dualistic nature of technical input and creative output I think lends itself especially well to this principle. I'd compare it loosely to trying to become good at baking: you have to wait for your concoction to bake every time before you can evaluate and adjust your recipe. In artistic fields in general, the shorter the loop is in which you evaluate your creative output and adjust your input, the more rapidly you can learn.

In CG the obvious loop is render>adjust>repeat, but I'm also talking about real time muscle-memory type learning. As someone that has attempted the miracle of creation on machines of widely ranging capability lately I can tell you there is a huge different between a click being registered now and it registering soonish. Being able to watch your brush strokes and commands execute at a reasonable frame rate is the only way to build hand-eye coordination. We're working in a medium where many already experience a learning curve at a motor-skill level while learning geometry and logic concepts in an attempt to make pretty pictures; we need all the help we can get.

In the 3D suite I use, Blender, a real-time physically-based renderer called EEVEE is starting to close the render>review loop. If the alleviation of this one frustration results in more enthusiastic beginners getting involved in 3D and a higher level of art being created, it wouldn't be the first time advances in technology have democratized a medium. I imagine the difference between real-time and deferred rendering to a CG artist might be similar to the difference between film and digital photography for learning photographers. Being able to see your compositions instantly greatly accelerates the learning process. This is how it must be; technology has to cater to the way our brains work. Millions of years of conditioning has given us incredible plasticity in what we can adapt to, but in order to most successfully integrate into our lives, digital technologies must retain some characteristics of the real world. We are toddlers knocking our sippy cup off the table to watch it fall: if that sippy cup disappears into a black box for an indeterminate time on its way to the floor, we're going to have to repeat the experiment more than otherwise neccessary. Low-level, developmental psychology concepts like object permanance must be applicable to software, or that software runs the risk of going against deeply-embedded human instincts.
