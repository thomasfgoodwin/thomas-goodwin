## Welcome to my new website
The journey here was rather trecherous, but it's good to be online and broadcasting.

## What are we doing here?
Excellent question. I plan on this blog being at least, but not limited to:

- A place to store my projects
- An online CV and resume
- A personal blog focusing on my work and steering clear of touchy-feely
- A resource for people learning cross-disciplenary art and design, and especially for people researching the cognitive psychology of audiovisual environments

Though I want to able to exert more control over how my work is presented, my primary motivation in creating this site is to unify the presentation of a body of work spanning too many media and too many topics to publish any other way. I plan on using this site to show "behind the scenes" type content in an effort to interest artists like myself in addition to a general audience.

I've always felt passionate about teaching others what I learn, so as soon as the dust settles with this blog I also want to start recording tutorial videos for some of the software I've picked up over the last few years, including Rhino, Blender, Photoshop, After Effects, VVVV, and maybe some of the web dev tools I used to make this. Any instructional video I make will be about high-level design and planning first, and technical execution second. Having spent a great deal of time in online communities for various digital arts, I find a ubiquitous focus on technical skill and technique in instruction. I think people are less apt to notice a lack in regards to soft skills like creative vision and story telling. While there are many _wrong ways_ to go about these things, there is no one universally accepted _right_ way.

## Help me decide!
But anyways, while the slate is clean - and while you by yourself, if you are reading this, likely comprise the majority of my current audience - think about what kinds of things you'd like to see here. I think I have my form submission at the bottom of each page working, but otherwise you can contact me myriad ways. It would please me greatly to hear from you, even if it's simply to second-guess my font choices (still on template defaults, actually, so maybe wait on that particular peice of criticism) or tell me about hot & horny singles in my area.
