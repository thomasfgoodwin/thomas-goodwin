I walk to the interstate and make a funny sign out of french fry packaging and boredom. A mother driving past sees me and looks up through the mirror at her elementary-school-aged passengers, cautioning them to never, _ever_  pick up hitchhikers, brandishing an accusatory index finger that might as well have been pointed at me. I yawn and brush my teeth.

My next ride is two hours long towards Chicago with a pretty girl my age. She gets me uncomfortably high, I miss my exit and end up in an unfavorable location in Joliet.
