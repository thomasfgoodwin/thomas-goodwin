You awake from your ritualistic Friday 8:15p disco nap and survey the state of your bedraggled friends, assembled loosely in groups across the hippest districts of one of the hippest cities on the planet. Energy is low, but spirits are nonetheless high. You groggily watch your roommate as they sip their Club Mate and instinctively feel through the change in your pocket, estimating your own Mate buying potential.

You yawn, but don't yet fret about your ability to face the rigors of the night ahead. Your shoes are dry, the coin purse in which you keep your drug collection lays lumpy in your fanny pack, and your black t-shirt has just recently acquired the right degree of must to ensure painless passage past any doorman you're likely to encounter.

You are Berlin, and you sleep, eat, snort and shit the grime of this darkly beautiful city at every opportunity.

You wear all black.

You bring no snapchatbooks, facetagrams, fourspaces, redditgrs or other social puppetstrings to the party.

You are the party. You know this. You do not need to let anyone else know this.

You exchange a knowing look with the doorman. He acknowledges your desire to enter the party. You acknowledge his desire to keep the party hip, happening, heavily distorted by mind-altering concoctions of the highest caliber, and free of fuckboi-ishness. You smile weakly as the giggling Americans several spots ahead of you are politely turned away. You resign to accept your fate, whatever judgement the guardian of this establishment decides that should be.

You are thrilled to be let in, but display nothing but a transient smirk after the doorman has turned his attention to the next coolest kid. You calmly cover the lenses of your phone, refuse to acknowledge the exorbiancy of the cover charge, and enter.

You begin to roll a cigarette with a filter pinched loosely in your lips. You survey your temporary home, not smug, but certainly self-satisfied. You are the social elite. You are the huddled, two-stepping masses.

All of the typical landmarks are there. There is the club-sanctioned drug dealer, conspicuous to those familiar with the tropes, idling by the genderless bathrooms. There are the spunions, wasted by mystery chemicals, pausing for varying stretches of time on dirty benches before throwing themselves back into the fray. There are beers and spiked mates, handrolled cigarettes, the smell of burning marijuana, unnaturally dialated pupils, and there is dancing. There is dancing so subtle and tasteful that in a dark room, and to the untrained eye, it may be confused with standing. There are lights and pounding, unending bass. There is an overwhelming hypnosis that draws you into a trance and consumes you, somehow catapulting you 6 hours into the future, where you look around in wonder and decide that the future is fine.
